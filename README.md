# PI Grand Pendule
This repository contains the implementation of a multidisciplinary master's project. This project consists of a pendulum model on which a camera has been installed to automatically identify the angle of the pendulum mast. A web page using the Flask framework is used to connect to the pendulum maquette, launch data acquisition and then download the data.
